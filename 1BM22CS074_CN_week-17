Wireshark is a powerful and widely used network protocol analyzer. It allows you to capture and inspect data packets traveling over a network in real time, making it a crucial tool for studying computer networks, troubleshooting network issues, and understanding protocols.

Key Features of Wireshark
Packet Capture: Captures live network traffic from various interfaces (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
Protocol Analysis: Supports hundreds of protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP).
Filtering: Offers powerful filters to isolate specific packets or traffic types.
Visualization: Displays packet details with hierarchical layers (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, etc.).
Export/Save Data: Allows saving captures for offline analysis.
Platform Support: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Use Cases of Wireshark
Network Troubleshooting:

Diagnosing slow network speeds.
Identifying network bottlenecks or misconfigurations.
Troubleshooting TCP handshakes and retransmissions.
Security Analysis:

Detecting malicious traffic or intrusions.
Analyzing potential data leaks or unauthorized access.
Protocol Study:

Learning about how protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP function in real time.
Understanding packet structures and communication flow.
Application Debugging:

Analyzing application-level traffic.
Debugging server-client communication for applications.
Steps to Use Wireshark
Download and Install Wireshark:

Get it from the official website: https://www.wireshark.org/.
Select a Network Interface:

Open Wireshark and choose the interface to monitor (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet).
Start Capturing Traffic:

Click the Start button to begin capturing packets on the selected interface.
Analyze Captured Data:

View the real-time data packets.
Use the filter bar to narrow down traffic, e.g., http, ip.addr == 192.168.1.1.
Stop and Save the Capture:

Stop the capture by clicking the Stop button.
Save the captured data for further analysis.
Common Filters
http: Show only HTTP traffic.
tcp.port == 80: Show traffic on TCP port 80.
ip.addr == 192.168.1.1: Show packets to or from a specific IP address.
udp: Show only UDP traffic.
